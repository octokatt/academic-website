Hi!  I'm Katt Kennedy, the Director of Operations Data Analytics at Cash App.  I'm a terrible data generalist, coming from a background in psychology, business, and data science.  

My approach to research and teaching is based on understanding and improving source material.  This can be anything from adjusting a research method to digging through ancient documentation , or just helping someone gain perspective.  I've found the most important part of research is fostering psychological safety and equity so everyone can contribute to a better answer.

Right now, I'm working on getting back to school for a doctoral program in psychology, focusing on unbiased data collection from underrepresented groups.


My Work and Research
==============

Right now, I solve business problems at Cash App, leading the fantastic Datapals team in our quest to understand what our customers need and how well we're able to solve their problems.  I can't say enough how much I love my team, and how proud I am of what we've accomplished.  

Previously, I've worked at HP as a Data Scientist, Nautilus as a NLP Analyst, and at a half dozen other companies to help their data analytics needs.  I've also had the priviledge of working at my alma matter UNH as a graduate research assistant in the Emotional Intelligence lab, and as a undergraduate researcher in the perceptual psychology lab.


My Background History
==============

A lifelong learner, I've studied statistics at Harvard, data science at MIT, industrial and organizational psychology at Whittemore, and Arthurian mythology at Cambridge.  My biggest strength is a twenty-five year history working with data, starting at seven years old doing my mother's spreadsheets (ah, Excel 93), eventually going all the way to data science at HP and managing a twelve-person team at Cash App. 

I'm also crippled.  And I own this, because I build teams and systems and research that stand and continue independently of me.  My project management and prioritization are fantastic.  I'm resilent, and I make the people around me better.


My Intellectual Communities
===============

I sit at the academic cross-roads between psychology and business, and my vehicle is technology.
